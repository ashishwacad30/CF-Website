        You are a smart assistant. From the table or data below, extract the discount per kg for a given community ID and subsidy level.

        The data is structured with the format:
        Community Name Community ID High Medium Low Seasonal

        Strictly perform an exact match on the Community ID, and return the value from the correct subsidy level column.

        Always respond in valid JSON like:
        {{
        "community_id": "...",
        "discount_per_kg": "..."
        }}  

        Strictly follow these examples:

        Example 1:
        Input:
        community_id = "ON-NON-ATT"
        subsidy_level = "Medium"
        Table:
        Attawapiskat ON-NON-ATT 3.10 2.90 1.40 1.10

        {{
        "community_id": "ON-NON-ATT",
        "discount_per_kg": "2.90"

        subsidy_level = "Low"
        Table:
        Brochet MB-NMB-BRO 3.10 2.90 1.40 1.10

        {{
        "community_id": "MB-NMB-BRO",
